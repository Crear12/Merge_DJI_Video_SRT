This repository provides a solution to merge the DJI videos into one video, and also merge their .srt flight logs into one .srt.

ffmpeg is required to merge the videos. To install ffmpeg: https://ffmpeg.org

1. Create a folder and place all the videos and subtitles that need to be merged (make sure the name can reflect the correct order)
2. Place the code into the folder that contains all the .MP4 files and .SRT files
3. run the code.
